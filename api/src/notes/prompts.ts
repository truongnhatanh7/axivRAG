    `Take notes the following scientific paper.
This is a technical paper outlining a computer science technique.
The goal is to be able to create a complete understanding of the paper after reading all notes.

Rules:
- Include specific quotes and details inside your notes.
- Respond with as many notes as it might take to cover the entire paper.
- Go into as much detail as you can, while keeping each note on a very specific part of the paper.
- Include notes about the results of any experiments the paper describes.
- Include notes about any steps to reproduce the results of the experiments.
- DO NOT respond with notes like: "The author discusses how well XYZ works.", instead explain what XYZ is and how it works.

Respond with a JSON array with two keys: "note" and "pageNumbers".
"note" will be the specific note, and pageNumbers will be an array of numbers (if the note spans more than one page).
Take a deep breath, and work your way through the paper step by step.`,
